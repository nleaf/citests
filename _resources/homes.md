    For anyone buying or selling a home, the real estate process can be at once
    exciting and stressful. From searching through home listings to completing a
    stack of closing paperwork, every step of the home buying journey demands
    reliable, quick access to information and services. Based in Virginia, Homes.com simplifies how people find, rent, and sell homes or commercial properties. Along with offering a directory of more than three million property listings, Homes.com tools include Match, Snap & Search, and Homes Connect to further aid linking brokers and customers with the perfect properties. Over the years, demand for Homes.com services has continued to rise, placing more pressure than ever on the company’s aging, on-premises IT environment.

    headline: The Scenario
    description: When potential buyers look up properties on Homes.com, they see information
      ranging from high-resolution home photos to pricing history, mortgage resources,
      and other useful details. But as the scope of Homes.com services grew, the company’s
      infrastructure was straining to keep up with more than 120 million monthly page
      views as people perused about 3 million active listings with nearly 2.6 billion
      associated images.

    headline: The Challenge
    description: The site’s previous infrastructure was inefficient to manage, built
      around an on-premises data center and a mix of cloud service providers. Along
      with rising hardware costs and challenges recovering data, the company’s legacy
      infrastructure was increasingly taxed to meet requirements for customer service-level
      agreements (SLAs). While Homes.com staff considered building a private cloud
      in-house, the team was concerned about the amount of resources that would require.

    headline: The Solution
    description: By working with Expedient, a premier VMware Cloud Provider partner,
      Homes.com was able to tap into the Expedient Enterprise Cloud (EEC) solution,
      powered by VMware Cloud infrastructure, that offers an ideal mix of cost-effective
      performance, reliability, and scalability. As part of EEC, Homes.com uses VMware
      Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) technologies, leveraging VMware vSphere,
      VMware vSAN, and VMware NSX Data Center, as a reliable foundation for its virtualized
      infrastructure integrating compute, storage, networking, and security.

With EEC, Homes.com was able to consolidate and migrate its business critical applications to one VMware-based cloud platform, enabling the Homes team to utilize its existing VMware knowledge and skill sets, resulting in both time and cost savings in its migration.
