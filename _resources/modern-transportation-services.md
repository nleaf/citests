    headline: The Scenario
    description: From the cabs of its big rigs to its back-office operations, Modern’s
      business is highly reliant on technology to ensure that customer demands are
      met. As a 24×7×365 business with trucks spread across lanes in 30 states, the
      continuous availability of Modern’s IT infrastructure is of utmost importance.

    headline: The Challenge
    description: Migrating its critical on-premises workloads to a fully managed VMware-based
      cloud such as EEC enabled Modern Transportation to walk away from an aging,
      on-premises infrastructure stack and avoid the large capital investment that
      a hardware refresh would require.

    headline: The Solution
    description: Modern Transportation leverages Expedient’s extensive solution suite
      and distributed data center footprint to operate a highly redundant and efficient
      hybrid IT architecture. In addition to using EEC for cloud-based infrastructure,
      the company continues to use Expedient colocation to host a few of its remaining
      physical servers and takes advantage of several managed services including cloud
      data protection, cloud file storage, dedicated firewall management and server
      management and monitoring.
