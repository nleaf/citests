#### Collaboration is the complement <br/> you're looking for from a partner

Expedient combines a <a href="/about/media/expedient-enhances-national-service-offerings-with-recent-western-expansion/">national data center footprint</a> – and the technical staff – to deliver <a href="/services/cloud/">cloud</a>, <a href="/services/colocation/">colocation</a>, <a href="/services/disaster-recovery/">disaster recovery</a>, and <a href="/services/security-and-compliance/">IT security</a> solutions. The Expedient Partner Program is designed to analyze, attract and maintain collaborative partnerships essential to delivering desired business outcomes. The network contains businesses that are already aligned with this philosophy: 

* Value-Added Resellers (VAR) - evolve from an exclusively on-site hardware sales model of the past to a monthly service subscription model 
* Managed Service Providers (MSP) - differentiate existing service capabilities to enable hybrid solutions that bridge legacy applications to cloud-enabled ones 
* Independent Software Vendors (ISV) -  establish foundational infrastructure delivery model(s) that complement the unique needs of different markets 
* Technology Consultants and Advisors - facilitate desired business outcomes through project execution and maintenance

#### Reseller Benefits

* **Revenue** - earn annuity compensation for the lifetime of the client agreement, including renewal periods 
* **Solutions** - gain service capabilities that may otherwise be out of reach or take too long to bring to market
* **Resources** - build relationships with local Expedient sales and technical experts and take advantage of their tools and experience
* **Control** - maintain the client relationship – including billing – and tailor solutions that add unique value
* **Support** - get marketing content, business planning, cooperative event participation and training

#### Client Benefits

* **Capacity** - An experienced, tenured and financially strong <a href="/about/media/expedient-secures-new-investment-sponsor-amp-capital-to-fund-continued-growth-and-expansion-of-its-data-center-and-enterprise-cloud-platforms/">organization</a>
* **Internationally Recognized IT Service Provider** - Expedient has received various <a href="/why-expedient/awards-and-accolades/">Awards and Accolades</a> from vendor partners and industry analysts 
* **Operational Excellence** - People, processes and procedures – continuously measured and improved over time – to make doing business efficient and pleasant 
* **Technology** - Continuously improving converged infrastructure composed of <a href="/why-expedient/technology-partners/">best-in-class components</a> 

Organizations are evolving to effectively compete in rapidly changing markets. Many existing and potential clients have a strong desire to establish and maintain local relationships in order to most closely align their business goals with the technology infrastructure necessary to support them. New service delivery approaches involving subscription services are creating new opportunities to take advantage of new capabilities and differentiate services by tailoring them to specific areas of need. 

Expedient operates best-in-class information technology infrastructure as a service (IaaS) that enables its partners to deliver more value to clients and generate additional annuity revenue for themselves while maintaining the trusted advisor relationship that instills confidence that both current and future needs can be fulfilled.
