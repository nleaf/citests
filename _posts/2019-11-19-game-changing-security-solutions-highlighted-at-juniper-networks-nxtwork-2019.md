For a second consecutive year, I attended the [Juniper NXTWORK 2019](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/dm/nxtwork-amer-2019/) conference in Las Vegas, NV, along with more than 1,000 other participants to discuss our business relationship with Juniper and learn about new technologies on the horizon.

The convergence of security with the entire network infrastructure is a key focus of Juniper Networks’ forward-looking protection strategy. Partners and clients like Expedient that have made the transition to software-defined and next-generation services by embracing the Juniper ecosystem, are taking advantage of integrated solutions with a particular focus on cloud and software technologies. In doing so, we’re _changing the game_ by delivering integrated solutions that help clients meet the requirements of government and industry compliance mandates and prepare them for a multi-cloud future.

This focus builds upon Juniper's connected security platform with the goal of extending security to all points of connection on the network to safeguard all users, infrastructure, and endpoints. For example, Expedient offers a variety of managed security services built atop the vSRX virtual firewall platform, including [Unified Threat Management (UTM)](https://www.expedient.com/services/security-and-compliance/#UnifiedThr), which enables content filtering and intrusion detection, and [Advanced Threat Prevention (ATP)](https://www.expedient.com/services/security-and-compliance/#AdvancedTh) to deliver next-generation protection against zero-day events through cloud-based malware detonation.

The Juniper strategy of extending security to every port involves building the functionality into its products such as EX and QFX switches, MX routers, and SRX firewalls. In the past, network threat detection has been limited to perimeter technologies like endpoint software and firewalls. Now, more integration along the path is possible to enable a truly threat-aware solution.

Managed [Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) Protection](https://www.expedient.com/services/security-and-compliance/#Distribute) and [Virtual Private Network (VPN) service](https://www.expedient.com/services/security-and-compliance/#VirtualPri) additionally enable reliable and secure data transmission across public networks.

The aforementioned transition to services was reinforced at the conference through keynote addresses, including one in particular from the athlete, businessman, and philanthropist – Earvin “Magic” Johnson. He spoke about the importance of differentiation and teamwork to winning. He connected the event’s theme of becoming a “Game Changer” to his many successful sports experiences, business ventures, and charitable pursuits.

As they do every year at NXTWORK, the Juniper education team offered extensive opportunities for Juniper Networks Certification Program (JNCP) achievement, including free testing for all associate, specialist, and professional-level exams, discounted expert-level lab exams, and savings on lab-based exams and written exams at future dates. Other educational sessions throughout the week included automation, multi-cloud, SD-WAN, and advanced network telemetry and monitoring topics.

Juniper also used the opportunity at NXTWORK to highlight its [recent acquisition of Mist Systems](https://newsroom.juniper.net/press-releases/juniper-networks-announces-intent-acquire-mist-systems-bring-ai-it-delivering), and describe how it is using their foundational artificial intelligence (AI) technology to evolve its enterprise networking products. While Mist’s initial products are focused on wireless networking, a capability that was previously missing from the company’s line-up, executives espoused AI as a technology that will significantly influence new and differentiated solutions across their products.
