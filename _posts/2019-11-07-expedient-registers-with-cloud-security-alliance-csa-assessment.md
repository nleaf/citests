The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Security, Trust, Assurance and Risk (STAR) registry publicly increases trust among cloud service providers (CSPs). The CSA STAR Program encompasses key principles of transparency, rigorous auditing, and harmonization of standards. Expedient now demonstrates its adherence to security and privacy best practices through its [registration with CSA STAR](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/registry/expedient/).

CSPs registered with the CSA STAR Program annually complete the Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ), which then becomes available to any organization seeking control alignment.

[Expedient Enterprise Cloud](https://www.expedient.com/services/cloud/) (EEC) infrastructure as a service (IaaS) offers a single pane of glass management interface with self-service network provisioning, intuitive monitoring and analytics, and self-service multi-tenancy for computing management that enables a policy-driven approach ensuring control. The service is a scalable VMware software-defined data center (SDDC) offering operational consistency between on-premises workloads and the cloud offered in three models:

* **Public Cloud** – maximum cost effectiveness through shared infrastructure
* **Private Cloud** – maximum segmentation for challenging compliance requirements through dedicated infrastructure
* **On-Site Private Cloud** – an Expedient private cloud at any qualified location to meet data residency and latency requirements

Clients choose the delivery model(s) most appropriate for their workloads and use the CAIQ to guide their own assessment of control alignment.

[Expedient data centers](https://www.expedient.com/data-centers/) support the Expedient Enterprise Cloud and a variety of complementary managed services. Partner data centers and client locations may also be used where applicable, making the [Expedient CSA STAR registration](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/registry/expedient/) a valuable tool for assessing compliance and security posture.

Expedient offers a variety of [security and compliance services and attestations](https://www.expedient.com/services/security-and-compliance/) that complement clients’ own efforts to maintain compliance.
