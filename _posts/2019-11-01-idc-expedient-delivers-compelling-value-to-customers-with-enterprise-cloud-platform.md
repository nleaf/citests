This [ExpertROI® Spotlight report](https://www.expedient.com/knowledgebase/resources/IDC-Whitepaper-Expedient-Delivers-Compelling-Value-to-Customers-with-Enterprise-Cloud-Platform/) by IDC provides a deep-dive analysis of the Expedient Enterprise Cloud (EEC) platform and explores the vision that Expedient shared with VMware to create a cloud services offering that enables businesses to leverage existing VMware investments and expertise. This shared vision and partnership created a unique cloud platform (EEC) that provides a much-needed alternative path to the cloud.

With EEC, enterprises with legacy applications running on VMware infrastructure don’t have to endure the costly and inefficient re-platforming process required for optimal performance on public clouds like AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform. By providing a managed cloud experience within the familiar confines of the VMware universe, Expedient has filled a sizeable gap in the cloud services marketplace according to the IDC Report.

Homes.com, a leading online real estate platform, is a case in point. To streamline its cloud operations and control costs, Homes.com consolidated all of its workloads on to the EEC platform. Watch Homes.com President, Dave Mele, discuss the business outcomes the company has realized since its migration EEC:

Strong demand for EEC’s differentiated functionality has transformed Expedient’s business in the year since it was launched. John White, Expedient’s Chief Innovation Officer and the lead visionary behind EEC, said in the report:

_“With companies understanding that a lift and shift to public cloud may not be feasible, whether it’s financial or from technical debt, that’s driving a lot of business our way, because our services are very differentiated. We’re one of the only companies in the market that has this VMware-based cloud offering, so we’re benefiting from being a first mover.”_
